# Spam Email Classifier

## Overview

This project is a Spam Email Classifier built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies in Python. The goal is to create a robust model that accurately classifies emails as either spam or not spam, based on their content.


## Introduction

Emails are an essential mode of communication, but with the increasing volume of spam emails, it becomes challenging to manage and prioritize important messages. The Spam Email Classifier addresses this issue by automatically categorizing emails as spam or non-spam, allowing users to focus on relevant information.

## Features

- **NLP-based Classification**: Utilizes Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze the content of emails.
- **AI/ML Integration**: Incorporates machine learning algorithms for effective spam classification.
- **Python Implementation**: Developed entirely in Python for ease of use and integration.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Other dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-email-classifier.git
```

Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd spam-email-classifier
```

## Usage

To use the Spam Email Classifier, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies as mentioned in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section.
2. Run the classifier on your email dataset.
3. Receive output indicating whether each email is classified as spam or not.

Example:

```python
from spam_classifier import SpamClassifier

classifier = SpamClassifier()
result = classifier.classify_email("Your email content goes here.")
print(result)
```
